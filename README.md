Blackjack Game (Python)
🎯 Overview

A simple command-line Blackjack game built with Python.
You play against the casino — try to get as close to 21 as possible without going over!

This project was created for fun and to practice Python fundamentals like:

Functions and loops

Conditional logic

List manipulation

Basic game design

🚀 How to Play

The game deals two cards each to you and the casino.

You can choose to:

Hit (y) → get another card

Stand (n) → stop drawing and let the casino play

The casino automatically draws until it reaches 17 or higher.

Whoever is closer to 21 (without going over) wins! 🎉
